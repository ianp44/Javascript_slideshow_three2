You are welcome to play around with this code under the GNU Public Licence 3.0 Ive put in it.

You can type in html slide snippets, convert them to javascript quotes lines format ("'" each end and a ",") 
then easily rearrange the seqeuence just by editing the control array.

Both these arrays are currently in the 
file: slide_show_2024_06_15_3.js


The three images and jellyfish images off the internet, and the two .mp3 files may play as the iframes switch in and out. They do on my phone ok. and my chromebook.

If you put all the files in a folder/directory of and chromebook and or windows computer then open/click on the .html file, it should work ok after you have clicked the start button.

This is a working but not complete or tidied up
javascript slideshow demo.

Hope to tidy it up and or 
add more information in
the fairly near future.
